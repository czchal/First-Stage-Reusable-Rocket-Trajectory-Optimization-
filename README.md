# First-Stage-Reusable-Rocket-Trajectory-Optimization-
This is a software that optimized the first stage of a reusable rocket trajectory. The optimization is done for three vehicles namely: Falcon 9, Electron and New Shepard. Three cases of landing have been considered. The software optimized the boost back, coasting and landing phase but not launch phase of the flight.
